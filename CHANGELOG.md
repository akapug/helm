# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha — 2026-07-19

The founding release: the whole steering station, built and fleet-deployed in
its first day.

### The home
- `~/.helm` — per-project knowledge chains (premises / heuristics / lexicon /
  prd / journal / evals / archive) + a global chain; existing knowledge homes
  adopted by symlink, never copied.
- Auto-map: real projects discovered from what agents actually did, across
  Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode; worktrees collapse to their repo; scratch
  dirs filtered; a shelf tier registers on-disk repos with no agent activity.

### The knowledge engine
- One typed store (prior / premise / lexicon / heuristic / reference /
  episodic) with one JIT resolver over every root; confidence with evidence
  logs; premises are human-only by construction.
- The drain: raw memory intake classified and routed to typed homes, with
  verified rollback nets and receipts. The drift report: contradictions,
  tier-crossings, and decays — silent when steady.
- Reflexes (signal → steer) and `helm inject`: one budget-capped, salience-
  gated per-turn context call any harness hook can make.
- Attested premises: captures commit a signed digest to a verifiable ledger;
  `premise-check` recomputes and quotes the finality tier; supersession forms
  a provable chain.

### The cockpit
- Sessions: every local session, all harnesses, project-grouped; content
  search inside transcripts; windowed transcript reads; re-homing;
  resume-optimized copies; one-paste resume commands; session capsules
  (the git era a session ended on).
- Accounts: live quota scorecard, rollover rescue (`swap`), credential-home
  lifecycle with identity verification and reversible archives.
- Configs: every config across every home and project, the load cascade
  resolved per seat, and a safe editor (backup → validate → atomic).
- The web app: four views (home / quota / sessions / configs) in one
  self-contained page — charts, transcript drawer, team tray, config editor —
  with a per-process mutation token on every write.

### The map
- Lineage: the project family tree with git-proven edges, external anchors,
  and a read-only ranked archive report.

### Operations
- `helm doctor` (read-only health), `helm evolve` (proposes, never mutates),
  skills census with divergence detection, `python3 -m helm`, PATH shim,
  systemd web service, fleet hook deployment with per-home backups.
